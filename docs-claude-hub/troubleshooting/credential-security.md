# Credential Security Implementation

This document describes the security measures implemented to prevent credential leaks in webhook responses.

## Overview

The webhook service handles sensitive credentials including:
- GitHub tokens (`GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- AWS access keys (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
- Other environment variables

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Docker Command Sanitization
In `src/services/claudeService.ts`:
- Docker commands are sanitized before logging
- Sensitive environment variables are replaced with `[REDACTED]`
- Sanitized commands are used in all error messages

```javascript
const sanitizedCommand = dockerCommand.replace(/-e [A-Z_]+=\"[^\"]*\"/g, (match) => {
  const envKey = match.match(/-e ([A-Z_]+)=\"/)[1];
  const sensitiveKeys = ['GITHUB_TOKEN', 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'];
  if (sensitiveKeys.includes(envKey)) {
    return `-e ${envKey}="[REDACTED]"`;
  }
  return match;
});
```

### 2. Output Sanitization
- stderr and stdout are sanitized to remove any credential values
- All occurrences of sensitive values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`
- Sanitized output is used in error messages and logs

### 3. Logger Redaction
In `src/utils/logger.ts`:
- Pino logger configured with comprehensive redaction paths
- Automatically redacts sensitive fields in log output
- Covers nested objects and various field patterns

### 4. Error Response Sanitization
In `src/controllers/githubController.ts`:
- Only error messages (not full stack traces) are sent to GitHub
- No raw stderr/stdout is exposed in webhook responses
- Generic error messages for internal server errors

## Testing

Several test scripts verify the security implementation:
- `test/test-credential-leak.js` - Tests sanitization logic
- `test/test-webhook-credentials.js` - Tests webhook behavior
- `test/test-logger-redaction.js` - Tests logger redaction

## Best Practices

1. Never log raw Docker commands with environment variables
2. Always sanitize error output before sending to external services
3. Use the logger's built-in redaction for all sensitive fields
4. Test credential handling with mock values regularly
5. Review error messages to ensure no sensitive data is exposed
